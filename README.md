<h1>All Hail The Pickle!!</h1>

<h2>About the Site:</h2>This app allows the user to press a button with a gif background that, once pressed, triggers a presentation of the Rick and Morty Character Pickle Rick. The presentation of Pickle Rick includes a photo, the character's name, species, gender and status of dead or alive. The background of the application is a gif of the iconic interdimensional portal.

<h2>Future Enhancements:</h2>
In the future I would like to implement a funtional search bar that allows the user to search any Rick and Morty character by name, and returns an image and details about them. I would also like to create an array of gifs that changes the applications background depending on the array index of the character the user searches.
